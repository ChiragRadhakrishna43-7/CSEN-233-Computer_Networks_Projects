WIRESHARK DNS LAB ANSWERS:

1. nslookup for vemanait.edu.in, its IP address is 103.143.46.17.

2. nslookup for University College, Dublin. The authoritative DNS servers obtained for ucd.ie are as follows:

	ucd.ie  nameserver = auth-ns1.ucd.ie
	ucd.ie  nameserver = auth-ns2.ucd.ie
	ucd.ie  nameserver = sec-ns.tcd.ie
	ucd.ie  nameserver = uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com
	ucd.ie  nameserver = uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
	ucd.ie  nameserver = scsnms.switch.ch

3. IP address obtained is 54.73.243.134 .

4. On locating the DNS query and response messages, it is determined that they are sent over UDP.

5. Destination port for the DNS Query Message is 53. The source port of the DNS response message is 53.

6. The DNS query message is sent to IP address 192.168.0.1. Using ipconfig, the IP address of the local DNS server is also 192.168.0.1 Hence, both addresses are the same.

7. The DNS query is of type A. It does not contain any answers, [Answer RRs = 0].

8. 2 answers were provided, [Answer RRs = 2]. Each of these answers had the host name, the address type, class, the time to live (TTL), data length and address.

		www.ietf.org: type A, class IN, addr 104.16.44.99

			Class: IN (0x0001)
			Time to live: 300 (5 minutes)
			Data length: 4
			Address: 104.16.45.99

 9. First SYN packet was addressed to 104.16.44.99. 104.16.44.99 is the first address contained in the DNS response message.
